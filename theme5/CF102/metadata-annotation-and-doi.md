## What is _metadata_?

<!-- TODO -->

Mirriam-Webster dictionary defines [data][webster-data] as: "factual
information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for
reasoning, discussion, or calculation", or: "information in digital
form that can be transmitted or processed."

[webster-data]: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data

For our purposes, let us use the latter definition: data is
information in digital form that can be stored, transmitted, or
processed.  Our experiments may consume data, produce data, transmit
data between instruments and computers, and we might want to analyze
data to make sense of it.  We store data somewhere, for eventual use
and/or sharing.

What is _metadata_ then?

Metadata is data that describes data, and what that description says
depends on context.

For example, [EXIF] (which is an abbreviation of "Exchangeable image
file format") is a form of image metadata.  When you take a picture
with cellphone, you get an image file.  In addition to "pure"
compressed on uncompressed image data, this image file also contains
some extra data describes the image: details about the camera, lens,
aperture, shutter speed, date and time at the time when the picture
was taken, location if available, such things.

In addition to EXIF, there is the metadata that the operating system
itself maintains about an image file: its ownership, date and time
when the file was created and modified (as far as the operating system
is concerned), and so on.

So when we talk about metadata, it is important to be clear about the
context in which we talk about metadata.

For CHESS experimenters, metadata would be information about
observational or experimental data that provides a "fuller picture"
about the observation or experiment.

## What is _DOI_?

A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a unique and stable string
assigned articles, books, and other works. DOIs make it easier to find
and retrieve works. DOIs are designed to be used by humans as well as
machines. DOIs are commonly used to identify publications and data
sets.

A DOI is meant to help us to resolve its target.  The location of an
online document or data set may change over time, because domain names
and links change.  However, since a DOI remains stable over time, with
a DOI people should be able to find the current location of the
target.  The publisher of the document or data set is responsible for
keeping the record up-to-date.

A DOI takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a
prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash, in `prefix/suffix` form.

Here is an example of a DOI: `10.1177/0306312719863494`.  Here the
prefix `10.1177` identifies the registrant of the DOI, and the suffix
`0306312719863494` identifies the article.

### How can I resolve a DOI?

To resolve the article referred by `10.1177/0306312719863494`, you
would use a _resolver_. The search box at [doi.org] is an interface to
such a resolver.

[doi.org]: https://www.doi.org/

A DOI is also resolvable as a URL using a proxy server. You could
prefix the DOI with `https://doi.org/` to get the URL
<https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312719863494>, which will redirect you to
the actual article, currently available at
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306312719863494>:

The <https://doi.org> resolver is operated by the DOI Foundation, a
non-profit that governs the DOI system.  The DOI system is
standardized by [International Organization for Standardization
(ISO)][iso].

[iso]: https://www.iso.org/


### How do I use DOI in citations?

Here's how you would cite the above-mentioned article:

> Mayernik, M. S. (2019). Metadata accounts: Achieving data and
> evidence in scientific research. Social Studies of Science, 49(5),
> 732-757. https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312719863494

<!-- TODO: APA, MLA, Chicago styles -->


### How do I get myself a DOI?

<!-- TODO: expand this -->
<!-- TODO: how does this work at CHESS? -->

In order to get a DOI for your paper or data set, you will need to
work with a [registration agency][agency], such as [crossref] or
[datacite].

[agency]: https://www.doi.org/the-community/existing-registration-agencies
[crossref]: https://www.crossref.org/
[datacite]: https://datacite.org/

    "In almost any real Jupyter notebook or standalone program we write, there will have to be places where different code paths are taken depending on what has happened leading up to there. Suppose we're looking at absorption at one specific wavelength and we know that some of our instruments are a little bit too sensitive to changes in humidity. Maybe the first spectrometer has some insulation that is just a little too porous and reads a bit high, but the second one is even worse. We have calibration constants we can apply, but we have to apply the right constant for each individual instrument."

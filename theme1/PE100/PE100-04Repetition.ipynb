    "    1. **Prompt for another number**\n",
    "1. Back at the while statement, we check and see that -999 is not a positive number, so we skip the code block and resume by running whatever follows it.\n",
    "1. Having exited the while loop entirely, print out the average value by dividing sum/count.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All the boldface and all-capitals lines above are there to emphasize how important it is to make sure your while loop isn't just checking the same thing over and over. If we didn't get a new number from the user each time through, the value of data_point would never change. That would result in an infinite loop, causing Python to never be able to complete the code in that cell. If it ever happens to you, and it probably will, the \"Interrupt Kernel\" command on JupyterLab's Kernel menu will stop the looping and let you get back to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is certainly versatile... it can be used any time you need to do something repeatedly. If you know how many times you need to have the code block execute, either when you write the code or when it's running, then keep a variable that is incremented in the block every time and exit the while loop when the counter hits the right number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `while` loops really shine is when it's impossible to know ahead of time how many times the code block should run. The example above, where we keep accepting numbers until the user signals there aren't any more, there's no way to know how many times to execute that loop until we see a negative number. In a case like that, the `while` loop is the only practical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if `while` loops are so great and solve every problem, why do we need anything else? The big reason is expressiveness: they can be a little awkward to understand, especially when you're looking at someone else's code. Having the conditional test separated from the action that establishes when to stop makes it a little awkward to understand (or debug!) someone else's code. This is especially true when we need to step through something by unusual increments.\n",

    "So what are we to do in these cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loops\n",

When it starts running its code block for the x=0 pass, the for loop for the `y` variable starts. 'y' assumes the values 0 through 3, so the first four lines printed out are for x=0, y=0, then x=0, y=1, and so on through x=0, y=3. Once that inner for loop completes, the outer for loop gets to iterate again. Now the inside for loop runs again, only this time we have x=1. That's why the next four lines are \"x=1, y=0\" through \"x=1, y=3\". Every time the outer loop runs another iteration, the inner loop gets to run all the way from start to finish. \n",

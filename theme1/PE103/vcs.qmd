Version control systems (or VCS) are software tools that are used to
track changes to source code or other collections of files.

Wikipedia has a [fairly long list][vcs-list] of version control
systems, each of them varying in practical usage and in implementation
details.  These days [Git][git] is the most popular version control
system in use. Git appears to have "won", and so Git is what we will
be discussing here.

[vcs-list]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software
[git]: https://git-scm.com/


## Why do we need version control?

When you work on a project, you often will want to save the state of
your code at various points, such that you can go back and forth
between these various points.  When you work on a project as part of a
team, you will also want to know who wrote some part of the code,
when, and why.

Whether you work alone or in a team, using a version control system
will help you achieve the above goals.  Sometimes your team member is
the past you (who should help you), or the future you (whom you should
help).

In the absence of a version control system, you will often will end up
with a chaotic mess which achieves the above goals in a poorer manner.
You will likely resort to several almost-same-but-not-quite files
variously named like so:

- `notebook.ipynb`
- `notebook-2024-05-01.ipynb`
- `notebook-2024-05-01-final.ipynb`
- `notebook-working.ipynb`
- `notebook-test.ipynb`
- `notebook-final.ipynb`

(Or think of the situation depicted by [this PHD Comics
strip][notfinal].)

[notfinal]: https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531

This scheme is basically a messy reinvention of a version control
system.  That might work in the simple cases, but it will soon break
down as you do more work on your project.

You want to avoid the cognitive overload of dealing with messy schemes
based on file names.  You want to use a version control system
properly.

Conceptually, you can think of the evolution of versions over time as
a directed graph:

![](versions.png)

Sometimes you branch out, say, when exploring a new direction:

![](versions-branch.png)

And you might eventually want to merge the branch to the "main" body
of your graph:

![](versions-branch-merge.png)

With a version control system, you can to do these things in a less
ad-hoc manner.


## Version control in practice: Git

Git is a command-line program that runs on all popular operating
systems.  If you use macOS or Linux, you probably have Git installed
already.  Here we assume that you are using the account that you have
with CLASSE.

Let us prime ourselves for Git with an XKCD strip:

[xkcd-git]: https://xkcd.com/1597/

As the cartoon suggests, Git has a (perhaps well-deserved) reputation
for being rather unfriendly or inscrutable.  With some familiarity and
practice, it can be tamed.

::: {.callout-note}

Depending on your background, you might find that learning Git by
first understanding the data model more helpful.  [Version control
module][missing-vcs] of the MIT course "The Missing Semester of Your
CS Education" and [Git from the Bottom Up][git-bottom-up] by John
Wiegley take this route.  These notes that you are currently reading,
however, take the more traditional path of introducing you to the more
frequently used Git commands.

[git-bottom-up]: https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/

:::

### First steps with Git

You can start trying out `git` by running the below in a terminal:

```{.bash}
$ git help
```

This should print some common Git commands used in various situations.

::: {.callout-note}

The specific output from `git help` might vary depending on the
version of Git that you are using.  You can find the version of Git
that you're using by running `git version`.

:::

<!-- If you are new to version control in general and Git in particular, -->
<!-- you will need to understand some concepts (such as _repositories_, -->
<!-- _cloning a repository_, _commits_, _log messages_, _branches_) in -->
<!-- order to understand what just happened above. Let us unpack stuff. -->


<!-- ## Git concepts -->

<!-- <\!-- TODO: elaborate -\-> -->

<!-- - commits -->
<!-- - staging area -->
<!-- - remotes -->
<!-- - branches -->

::: {.callout-note}
You might find `git help -g` (or `git help --guides`) useful:

```{.bash}
$ git help -g
The common Git guides are:

   attributes   Defining attributes per path
   glossary     A Git glossary
   ignore       Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
   modules      Defining submodule properties
   revisions    Specifying revisions and ranges for Git
   tutorial     A tutorial introduction to Git (for version 1.5.1 or newer)
   workflows    An overview of recommended workflows with Git

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' lists available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
```
:::

## Getting started with Git

Git commands are generally of the form `git <subcommand>`, where
`<subcommand>` is for the specific operation you want to do.  We will
discuss them in the following sections.

There is also a little bit of configuration that you should do, before
you are able to `git add` and `git commit` your changes.  Let us start
with this configuration.


### Initial configuration

Git keeps track of who makes changes.  For this to work, you'll need
to configure Git using `git config` subcommand:

```{.bash}
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

This will write configuration to a file named `.gitconfig` in your
home directory.

```{.bash}
$ cat ~/.gitconfig
[user]
	name = Your Name
	email = you@example.com
```

Of course, you should use "real" values instead of `Your Name` and
`you@example.com`.


### Starting a new repository

Let us start with a very simple example, just for practice.  We will
create a brand new Git repository, and commit some changes to it.

Now, what is a repository, and what are commits?

- A Git **repository** is essentially a directory where Git tracks
your files and manages changes to them.  It is a database that stores
your project's history. This history includes every version of every
file in your project, and who made those changes, and when, among
other things.

- A Git **commit** is a snapshot of your project at some point in
time.  You can think of them as versions.

On `lnx201`, let us create a new directory (with `mkdir hello-world`),
change to that directory (with `cd hello-world`), create a file in
that repository, and initialize a git repository there (with `git
init`):

```{.bash}
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world/
$ echo "hello $USER"
hello ssasidharan
$ echo "hello $USER" > hello.txt
$ cat hello.txt
hello ssasidharan
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ssasidharan/hello-world/.git/
```

That created an empty repository, meaning, nothing has been added to
it.  As you can see, `git init` created a directory named `.git/`
inside `hello-world/`.  This `.git` directory is the repository's
"database" -- this is where Git stores information about your project,
including version history, configuration settings, and references to
commits, and more.

The `"."` prefix in `.git/` means that it is a "hidden" directory.  It
won't appear in the output of commands such as `ls`.  You will need to
use `ls --all` or `ls -a`.

Running `git status` will show an "untracked file":

```{.bash}
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	hello.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

::: {.callout-note}

What does `On branch master` mean? 

Think of a branch as a line of development.  Your work almost always
happen on a branch.  When you start a project, Git uses a default
branch called a `master`.  With newer versions of Git (since , the default
branch is called `main`.

<!-- If you want to use `main` as the default branch, do: -->

<!-- ```{.bash} -->
<!-- $ git config --global init.defaultBranch main -->
<!-- ``` -->

:::

An "untracked file" means Git do not know about the file.  We will
need to add that file to Git.

### Adding changes

Let us add `hello.txt` to the repository, and check the status again:

```{.bash}
$ git add hello.txt
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   hello.txt
#
```

The command `git add hello.txt` adds the file `hello.txt` to the
repository.  You could also have done a `git add .` to add all files
in the directory to the repository.

Note that `git add hello.txt` does not _commit_ `hello.txt` to the
repository; it just tells Git to pay attention to the file.  With `git
status`, we can see that Git is aware of the fact that there are some
changes to be committed in the repository.


### Committing changes

Use `git commit` to actually commit the tracked file to the
repository:

```{.bash}
$ git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
[master (root-commit) 708bfca] Add hello.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

The string following `-m` option (`-m` is short for `--message`) is a
_commit message_.  You use commit messages to describe the change in a
single short line.

Note that commit messages are not required to be single lines. On
`lnx201`, if you run `git commit` without `-m <message>`, an editor
will be launched where you can write a more detailed commit message.
You can configure a different editor for writing commit messages, if
you want to do so.  As a general rule, your commit message should
start with a short description of the commit in a single line,
followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed description of
the commit.

Over time, your commit messages will tell the story about how your
project evolved. More details in commit messages would be quite useful
when you or someone else revisit the change at some point in the
future.

[xkcd-git-commit]: https://xkcd.com/1296/
[by-nc]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/

Now we can use `git status` to re-check status of the repository:

```{.bash}
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

We can use `git log` to view the commit history:

```{.bash}
$ git log
commit 708bfcafe32528e90e1d52fd6b94f0c44476518a
Author: Sajith Sasidharan <ssasidharan@lnx201.classe.cornell.edu>
Date:   Tue Apr 23 19:10:02 2024 -0400

    Add hello.txt
```

The `commit 708bfcafe32528e90e1d52fd6b94f0c44476518a` part is what is
known as a "commmit hash" or a "commit ID".  It is a 40-character
hexadecimal string generated using a cryptographic hashing algorithm.
Each commits get a unique commit hash, and represents the state of the
repository at a given point of time.

Let us add some more changes, and commit them:

```{.bash}
$ echo "hello from $HOSTNAME" >> hello.txt
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   hello.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit -m "Update hello.txt"
[master 233c748] Update hello.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

Try `git log` to show commit history again:

```{.bash}
$ git log
commit 233c748ad3dd31c11a3bc12d0cf106d7fe888fc3
Author: Sajith Sasidharan <ssasidharan@lnx201.classe.cornell.edu>
Date:   Tue Apr 23 19:22:29 2024 -0400

    Update hello.txt

commit 708bfcafe32528e90e1d52fd6b94f0c44476518a
Author: Sajith Sasidharan <ssasidharan@lnx201.classe.cornell.edu>
Date:   Tue Apr 23 19:10:02 2024 -0400

    Add hello.txt
```

### Some more terminology

Files that are tracked by Git can be in one of these stages:

- **Modified**: you have changed the file, but has not added or
  committed it.
- **Staged**: you have done a `git add` on the file, thus moving into
  the "staging area" of the repository.
- **Committed**: you have done a `git commit`, thus storing the file in
  your local Git database.

Let us see what this means with a diagram:

![](staging.png)

The **working tree** is what you get when you initialize repository
(with `git init`) or check out a repository (with `git clone`).  The
files you work with are here.  When you modify a file, you will need
to move it to the **staging area** before committing it.

The **staging area** stores information about what will go into your
next commit.  In Git terminology, staging area is also called the
**index**.

When you do `git commit`, your staged changes will be committed to the
database in `.git` directory.  With these two-step actions, you get
more control over what set of changes you get to commit to the
project.

With `git commit -a` (or `git commit --all`), you can stage the
changes and commit them at once:

```{.bash}
$ echo "third line" >> hello.txt
$ git commit -am "Add a third line"
```

Note that `git commit -am "Add a third line"` is the same as `git
commit --all --message "Add a third line"`.

### Reviewing changes

We have `git status` and `git log` in action already.  Another command
is `git diff`, which is used to find the difference between two commits:

```{.bash}
$ git diff 708bfcafe32528e90e1d52fd6b94f0c44476518a 233c748ad3dd31c11a3bc12d0cf106d7fe888fc3
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index c5d1025..3f4c47c 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello ssasidharan
+hello from lnx201.classe.cornell.edu
```

A useful shortcut is `git diff HEAD~`:

```{.bash}
$ git diff HEAD~
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index c5d1025..3f4c47c 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello ssasidharan
+hello from lnx201.classe.cornell.edu
```

In Git parlance, `HEAD` implies the last commit on the current branch,
and `HEAD~` is the commit before that, and `git diff HEAD~` would
print the difference between the latest commit and the one before
that.

Eventually, once there are more commits in the repository, you can
view the difference with an arbitrary number of commits in history
with `git diff HEAD~~~` (or, more conveniently: `git diff HEAD~3`),
and so on.  You get the idea.

Another shortcut for those really long commit hashes is using a
smaller prefix of them.  You can find these "short hashes" with `git
log --abbrev-commit` or `git log --oneline`:

```{.bash}
$ git log --oneline
233c748 Update hello.txt
708bfca Add hello.txt
$ git diff 708bfca 233c748
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index c5d1025..3f4c47c 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello ssasidharan
+hello from lnx201.classe.cornell.edu
```

### Removing files

To remove files from your project, use `git rm <path>` followed by
`git commit`:

```{.bash}
$ git rm hello.txt
$ git commit -m "Remove hello.txt"
```

## Undoing changes

You have made some changes, but you don't actually want to keep those
changes.  You do not want to add them or commit them.  To discard all
such changes in your working directory, use `git reset`:

```{.bash}
$ git reset --hard HEAD
```

If you want to keep the changes but continue working on them without
committing yet, you probably want to do:

```{.bash}
$ git reset --soft HEAD
```

Often you can do a `git reset <commit>` to restore the state of your
working tree to what is reflected by `<commit>`.

At any point, you can use `git reflog` (or "reference log") to find
where you were previously:

```{.bash}
$  git reflog 
ddec657 HEAD@{0}: commit: Remove hello.txt
d73c5c8 HEAD@{1}: commit: Add a third line
233c748 HEAD@{2}: commit: Update hello.txt
708bfca HEAD@{3}: commit (initial): Add hello.txt
```

This output is useful when you want to set the state of your working
tree using `git reset` or `git checkout`.

Once you have made a commit, you can undo that with `git revert`,
which will create a new commit which will revert undesired changes:

```{.bash}
$ git revert <commit>
```


### Ignoring (some) files

Some files just should not be under version control.  Examples would
be:

- Anything generated by a build process, or a compiler, or a test
  suite, or some such.  You do not want to commit the byte-compiled
  `.pyc` files, for example.
- Secrets, or files containing secrets (such as passwords, or tokens).
- Editor configuration files.

You should tell Git to ignore these files by adding their names to a
`.gitignore` file, with one name on a line, so that `git status` will
ignore them.  You can use wildcard patterns such as `*.pyc`.

On `lnx201`, you probably should ignore the `.directoryhash` files
automatically created by the file system; when you use macOS, you want
to ignore `.DS_Store` files.  So your `.gitignore` should have:

```{.conf}
.directoryhash
.DS_Store
```

Take a look at X-CITE course's [.gitignore] for another example.

[.gitignore]: https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE/blob/main/.gitignore


## Working with branches

A branch is a line of development.  The default branch for Git is
`master` (or `main`, for newer versions of Git).  If you are working
on a small project by yourself, you probably can commit your changes
on the default branch.

However, when working on bigger projects or working with others, you
will want to use branches.  This will ensure that there is less
"churn" in the default branch, and keep things manageable.

You will create a branch when you implement a feature, for example,
and when you are done implementing the feature, you will merge that
branch to the default branch.

![](branching.png)

Nothing stops you from branching off from your non-`main` branches and
merging back to the branch either.  Branching and merging are
(usually!) quick and easy with Git.  (Well, except when there are
merge conflicts.  This happens when the changes on your branches
diverge from the changes on the branch that you are trying to merge
to.)

<!-- The particular branching strategy will likely depend on the project. -->
<!-- Some projects may choose to have a fast moving `develop` branch, and a -->
<!-- slow moving `main` branch. -->

To find the branch on which you currently are, use:

```{.bash}
$ git branch
```

To create a new branch named `feature-branch`, use:

```{.bash}
$ git branch feature-branch
```

To switch to the newly created `feature-branch`, do:

```{.bash}
$ git checkout feature-branch
```

You can also create a branch and check it out in a single command:

```{.bash}
$ git checkout -b feature-branch
```

When you are ready to merge `feature-branch` to `main` branch, you
will do:

```{.bash}
$ git checkout main 
$ git merge feature-branch
```

If the merge is not successful, you will encounter an error message:

```{.bash}
$ git merge feature-branch 
Auto-merging test.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in test.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Now `git status` would indicate that you have a situation:

```{.bash}
$ git status 
# On branch master
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
#
#	both modified:      test.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Git would have added some conflict markers (`<<<<<<<` and `=======`
and `>>>>>>>`) to indicate the places where it had trouble merging.

```{.md filename="test.txt"}
<<<<<<< HEAD
line 1
line 2
=======
line 3
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

This is when you open a text editor, find the conflicts, and _resolve_
them manually.  It is up to you to accept what you want and reject
what you do not. You should do that, and remove the conflict markers.
You will probably end up with:

```{.md filename="test.txt"}
line 1
line 2
line 3
```

Now you can commit this with:

```{.bash}
$ git commit -am "Resolve conflict"
```

In more complicated situations, you will probably have to use a merge
tool.  See [git-mergetool] for details.

[git-mergetool]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool 


## Working with tags

Tags are used to mark certain points in a repository's history as
important in some manner. In the case of a release, you will want to
tag the commit associated with the release with `v1.0.0` or `v1.0.1`,
for example.

You can list the tags present in your repository with:

```{.bash}
$ git tag
```

You can create a tag with:

```{.bash}
$ git tag 1.0.0
```

You can have a tag point at a specific commit:

```{.bash}
$ git tag 1.0.1 3de49cc
```

To delete a tag:

```{.bash}
$ git tag -d 1.0.1
```

## Working with remote repositories

This far, we've talked about how you work in a local repository.

You will want to be able to share your work with others, and be able
to check out the projects others have created.  This is typically done
with hosting your repository somewhere in a server.  These are
called remote repositories.

![](remote-repository.png)

You will `git clone` remote repositories, and you will `git fetch` or
`git pull` updates them from, and you will `git push` your changes to
them.  In practice, you will very likely use an account on a code
hosting site such as GitHub, and push your code to a repository there.  

::: {.callout-note}

While working with a central remote repository is the most usual Git
workflow, it is worth noting that Git enables other kinds of workflows
also.  See the chapter [Distributed Git - Distributed
Workflows][git-dist] from Pro Git for some examples.

[git-dist]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows

:::

These very notes that you are currently reading are version controlled
using Git, and they are hosted at the GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE/>.  You can get a local copy of
that repository using `git clone` command:

```{.bash}
$ git clone https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE.git
Cloning into 'X-CITE'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 948, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (485/485), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (266/266), done.
remote: Total 948 (delta 228), reused 421 (delta 172), pack-reused 463
Receiving objects: 100% (948/948), 4.52 MiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (446/446), done.
```

You can `cd` into that directory now with `cd X-CITE`, and then run
some `git` commands such as `git status` and `git log` there:

```{.bash}
$ cd X-CITE/
$ git status
# On branch main

$ git log

### Getting updates from a remote repository

After you originally cloned a remote repository, other people might
have pushed new commits or branches or tags there.  Using `git fetch`
command will retrieve those updates, but without committing them to
your local repository.

```{.bash}
$ git fetch origin
```

Here `origin` refers to the remote repository.  You can list remote
repository with `git remote`, and `git remote -v` will print some more
details about them.

You can then do `git diff origin/main` to view the changes, and do
`git merge origin/main` (or `git rebase origin/main`) to get those
changes in your local copy.

When you want to fetch updates from the remote repository and
automatically merge them into your current branch in one step, you
will do a `git pull`:

```{.bash}
$ git pull
```

Here you are fetching and merging changes from the `main` branch in
the remote repository to your current local branch.

### Getting updates to a remote repository

The inverse of a `git pull` is `git push`.  You use a `git push` to
get your changes to a remote repository:

```{.bash}
$ git push origin main
```

If you are trying to push to X-CITE repository, this will ask for your
username and password, and even if they are correct, `git push` will
most likely fail, because you do not have the necessary permissions to
write to the remote repository.

::: {.callout-note}

If you want to add your changes to X-CITE repository on GitHub, you
will want to make your changes in your own fork of the repository, and
send a pull request to X-CITE repository.  This is a somewhat separate
discussion.  Start with "[GitHub][git-book-github]" chapter of "Pro
Git" book, or GitHub's [documentation][github-start].

A software "forge" is a hosting service that can host your Git
repositories, and provide many additional services (such as bug
tracking, code reviews, continuous integration, etc) that helps you
collaborate with other people.

 - [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) happens to be the most popular
   one.
 - [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com).  
   - Many organizations and projects choose to self-host a version of
     GitLab. See [CLASSE
     GitLab](https://gitlab01.classe.cornell.edu/explore), for
     example.
 - [BitBucket.com](https://bitbucket.org/)
 - [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/)

Some people prefer to self-host a forge, and some people prefer no
forge at all. Since Git is a _distributed_ version control system, and
you should be able to collaborate with no forge at all: you can share
your changes as email attachments, if you want.


## Exercises

1. Create an account on GitHub.com (or another forge of your choice),
   if you do not have an account there already.  Create a new
   repository on the forge of your choice.  Push some code that you
   are working on to that repository.

3. Make some more changes to your project, and commit them. Push those
   commits also to the Git repository.

4. Create a Git tag (based on today's date, or a version number), and
   push the tag to your repository.
   
5. If you want to add a new feature to your project, create a branch,
   and make your changes on the branch. When you are done, merge the
   feature branch to your `main` or `master` branch.
   
5. If you find errors in these notes, or want to suggest improvements,
   report them by creating an issue on
   <https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE/>.
   
6. If you want to propose some changes to these notes (such a fixing a
   mistake or improving these notes), create a pull request against
   <https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/X-CITE/>.

# Basic / on-the-fly data analysis, viewing detector images

The following hands-on exercises demonstrate various methods of analyzing and viewing x-ray detector images. The first two exercises require an activated CLASSE account and access to the CLASSE JupyterHub.
1. Low complexity: [Azimuthal integration of 2D diffraction patterns](https://github.com/CHESSComputing/CHAP-Training-Examples-Materials/tree/main/example_01)
    - Skills: CHAP, python, Linux command line, navigating CHESS filesystems, Jupyter notebooks, matplotlib
3. Medium complexity: [Tomographic reconstruction](https://github.com/CHESSComputing/CHAP-Training-Examples-Materials/tree/main/example_02)
    - Skills: CHAP, python, Linux command line, navigating CHESS filesystems, NoMachine, NeXpy, Galaxy
5. Low complexity: [Browser-based data visualization dashboard](http://services.nationalsciencedatafabric.org/chess/)
    - Practice choosing a dataset, navigating through an image stack, zooming in and out, changing the color palette, switching between lin/log scale, dropping probes in multiple locations
    - Skills: Examining detector images
